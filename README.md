# NewsBalance
React Native App that displays news to users based on how balanced an article is. This rating is determined by voting.

## Usage
Right now this project is iOS only because there are some issues with packages that I used on Android.
This was tested on the iPhone 6 simulator, but it should scale to any screen size. To run just run the command
'react-native run-ios' in this directory, with react native installed.

## Additions
-Like I said earlier, this will need to be updated to support Android
-The sorting of articles will be updated in the future to sort by total views and rating, so trending stories appear first
-New sources will be added, along with a more comprehensive query to ensure the highest quality articles are shown. But that is done in the back-end.
